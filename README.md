<h1>Activity: Apply filters to SQL queries</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab, I, as a security analyst, focused on honing data analysis skills, recognizing that the retrieval of specific information often relies on multiple factors. The task involved leveraging SQL queries and implementing filters using AND, OR, and NOT operators to create intricate conditions for data extraction. This hands-on activity equipped me with the practical knowledge and experience to proficiently run complex SQL queries, allowing for precise and targeted retrieval of information from databases. Through this exercise, I enhanced my ability to navigate and manipulate data, a crucial skillset for effective analysis in the role of a security analyst.
